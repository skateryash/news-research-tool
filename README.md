üöÄ **News Research Tool**: Revolutionizing Information Retrieval with AI üîç

## Overview
The News Research Tool is an advanced application designed to streamline the process of extracting relevant information from vast news sources. Leveraging the latest in natural language processing (NLP) and vector search technologies, this tool offers researchers, journalists, and professionals a powerful means to enhance productivity and decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Advanced NLP Processing**: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models to preprocess and understand textual content.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Converts news articles into high-dimensional vectors using HuggingFace embeddings.
- **Efficient Vector Store**: Stores vectors in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for rapid and accurate similarity searches.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Allows users to query the knowledge base with natural language, retrieving concise and relevant answers.
- **Source Attribution**: Provides links to the original news articles supporting the generated answers.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: LangChain framework
- **Frontend**: Streamlit interface
- **Libraries**: HuggingFace, FAISS, Google Gemini API
